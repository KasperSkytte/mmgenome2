\arguments{
\item{mm}{(\emph{required}) A dataframe loaded with \code{\link{mmload}}.}

\item{x}{(\emph{required}) The variable from \code{mm} to plot on the first axis.}

\item{y}{(\emph{required}) The variable from \code{mm} to plot on the second axis.}

\item{min_length}{Remove scaffolds with a length at or below this value before plotting. (\emph{Default: } \code{0})}

\item{color_by}{Color the scaffolds by a variable in \code{mm}. (\emph{Default: } \code{NULL})}

\item{locator}{(\emph{Logical}) When \code{TRUE}, left-clicks in the plot are captured and the exact x/y-coordinates of the mouse clicks are returned. These coordinates can be used to highlight a selection of scaffolds in the plot, and also be used with \code{\link{mmextract}} to extract all scaffolds within the selection from the data. (\emph{Default: } \code{FALSE})}

\item{selection}{A 2-column dataframe with the x and y coordinates of points with which to draw a polygon onto the plot to highlight a selected region. A selection can be obtained by using the locator feature (by \code{locator = TRUE}). (\emph{Default: } \code{NULL})}

\item{network}{Paired-end or mate-pair connections between scaffolds in long format. The first and second columns must contain all connected scaffold pairs and the third column the number of connections.}

\item{shared_genes}{(\emph{Logical}) If \code{TRUE}, lines will be drawn between scaffolds with any shared gene(s). (\emph{Default: } \code{FALSE})}

\item{label_scaffolds}{Add text labels (with text from the variable in mm defined by \code{label_scaffolds_by}) to a selection of scaffolds by providing either a character vector of scaffold names, or a dataframe with scaffold names in the first column. If set to \code{TRUE} then \emph{all} scaffolds will be labelled. (\emph{Default: } \code{FALSE})}

\item{label_scaffolds_by}{The variable in mm by which to label the scaffolds defined by \code{label_scaffolds}. (\emph{Default: } \code{"scaffold"})}

\item{highlight_scaffolds}{A vector of scaffold names or a dataframe loaded with \code{\link{mmload}} containing scaffolds to highlight in the plot with the color set by \code{highlight_color}. (\emph{Default: } \code{NULL})}

\item{highlight_color}{The color with which to highlight the scaffolds set by \code{highlight}. (\emph{Default: } \code{"darkred"})}

\item{x_scale}{Log10-scale (\code{"log10"}) or square-root scale \code{"sqrt"} the x axis. (\emph{Default: } \code{NULL})}

\item{x_limits}{Axis limits of the x axis. (\emph{Default: } \code{NULL})}

\item{y_scale}{Log10-scale (\code{"log10"}) or square-root scale \code{"sqrt"} the y axis. (\emph{Default: } \code{NULL})}

\item{y_limits}{Axis limits of the y axis. (\emph{Default: } \code{NULL})}

\item{alpha}{The transparancy of the scaffold points, where 0 is invisible and 1 is opaque. (\emph{Default: } \code{0.1})}

\item{fixed_size}{A fixed size for all scaffolds if set. If \code{NULL} then the scaffolds are scaled by length. (\emph{Default: } \code{NULL})}

\item{size_scale}{A factor to scale the sizes of the scaffolds plotted. Only applies when \code{fixed_size} is set to \code{NULL} and the scaffolds are scaled by length. (\emph{Default: } \code{1})}

\item{color_vector}{The colors from which to generate a color gradient when \code{color_by} is set and the variable is continuous. Any number of colors can be used. (\emph{Default: } \code{c("red", "green", "blue")})}

\item{color_scale_log10}{(\emph{Logical}) Log10-scale the color gradient when \code{color_by} is set and the variable is continuous (\emph{Default: } \code{FALSE})}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object.
}
\description{
Plots any information about the scaffolds contained in the given mm object as a scatterplot, for example different coverage variables, scaffold length, GC content, or anything else that were loaded with \code{\link{mmload}}. Scaffolds can then be highlighted and extracted using the locator and selection features.
