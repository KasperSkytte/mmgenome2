\title{Print basic statistics of metagenome data}
\usage{
mmstats(mm, original_data = NULL, print = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mm}{(\emph{required}) A dataframe loaded with \code{\link{mmload}}.}

\item{original_data}{If \code{mm} is a subset/extraction of another dataframe loaded with \code{\link{mmload}}, then provide here the original dataframe from which the extraction originates to compare the extraction to the original data, see examples. (\emph{Default: } \code{NULL})}

\item{print}{(\emph{logical}) Whether to print the calculated stats or not. (\emph{Default: } \code{TRUE})}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the calculated stats is returned invisibly.
}
\description{
Calculates some basic statistics like the N50 length, minimum-, mean-, and maximum scaffold lengths, mean GC content, information about essential genes, and more...
}
\details{
The returned stats are calculated as follows:
\itemize{
   \item Scaffolds: The number of different scaffolds in the assembly.
   \item N50: The shortest sequence length at 50% of the assembly.
   \item Length.total: The total size of the assembly.
   \item Length.max: The size of the largest scaffold in the assembly.
   \item Length.mean: The average scaffold size in the assembly.
   \item Length.min: The size of the smallest scaffold in the assembly.
   \item weighted_GC_mean: The average GC content in the assembly, weighted by scaffold sizes.
   \item cov_*: The average coverage of each coverage variable in mm, weighted by scaffold sizes. (Only columns starting with "cov_" will be shown)
   \item Ess.genes.total: The total number of essential genes, if any have been loaded. 
   \item Ess.genes.unique: The number of unique essential genes, if any have been loaded. 
}
}
\examples{
library(mmgenome2)
data(mmgenome2)
mmstats(mmgenome2)

#Compare an extraction with the original data from which the extraction originates:
selection <- data.frame(cov_C13.11.25 = c(7.2, 16.2, 25.2, 23.3, 10.1),
                        cov_C14.01.09 = c(47, 77, 52.8, 29.5, 22.1))
mmgenome2_extraction <- mmextract(mmgenome2, 
                                  selection = selection)
                                  
mmstats(mmgenome2_extraction, original_data = mmgenome2)
