\title{Find connections of a subset of scaffolds in a larger set of scaffolds}
\usage{
mmexpand_network(mm, scaffolds, network, min_connections = 2,
  include_connections = "direct")
}
\arguments{
\item{mm}{(\emph{required}) A dataframe loaded with \code{\link{mmload}} in which to find connections from \code{scaffolds}.}

\item{scaffolds}{(\emph{required}) The scaffolds from which to find connections in \code{mm}. Must be a vector of scaffold names or a dataframe with scaffold names in the first column.}

\item{network}{(\emph{required}) Paired-end or mate-pair connections between scaffolds in long format. The first and second columns must contain all connected scaffold pairs and the third column the number of connections.}

\item{min_connections}{Filter all scaffold pairs with equal to or less than this number of connections before the extraction. (\emph{Default: } \code{2})}

\item{include_connections}{The connections to include. One of the following:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"direct"}}{Extract only scaffolds from \code{mm} that are directly connected to any of the scaffolds in \code{scaffolds}. (\emph{default})}
  \item{\code{"all"}}{Same as \code{"direct"}, except that any further connections to connected scaffolds are also included, continuing until no further connections are found.}
}}
}
\value{
A dataframe (tibble) compatible with other mmgenome2 functions.
}
\description{
Searches for all connections between the given set of \code{scaffolds} and the scaffolds in \code{mm}. The given set of \code{scaffolds} is often a subset of \code{mm}, but can also be a manually selected set of scaffolds from which to find connections in \code{mm}.
